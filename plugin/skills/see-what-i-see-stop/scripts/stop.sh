# Looks up the watcher's PID from $DIR/.watch.pid (where $DIR is
# resolved the same way watch.sh resolves it: --directory flag, then
# .SeeWhatISee config file in . or $HOME, then $HOME/Downloads/SeeWhatISee).
# Sends SIGTERM and removes the pidfile.

# This is the same effect as `watch.sh --stop`. We split it out so the
# /see-what-i-see-stop skill has a small dedicated script that doesn't
# need to bundle (or know about) the watcher loop.
