# Thin wrapper: defer to SeeWhatISee.py in streaming --watch mode.
#
# Long-running: emits one capture record per line as captures arrive,
# until killed. Publishes the watch session so /see-what-i-see-stop
# (or a later watcher) can replace it. Meant to be run backgrounded,
# with the client reading each line as it is printed.
#
# The single-shot alternative is watch-once.sh — one record per run,
# for clients that can't stream. A bundle ships whichever of the two
# its client can drive; some ship only one.
#
# SeeWhatISee.py lives in the see-what-i-see skill's scripts/ dir;
# reach across sibling-relative.
