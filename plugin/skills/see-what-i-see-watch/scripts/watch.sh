# Watch ~/Downloads/SeeWhatISee/log.json and emit its last line each
# time the SeeWhatISee Chrome extension rewrites it.
#
# Default mode: wait for the next change, emit, and exit.
# --loop: keep watching and emitting until killed.
# --after TIMESTAMP: check log.json for captures newer than the record
#   whose timestamp matches TIMESTAMP, and emit them immediately before
#   watching. TIMESTAMP is the `timestamp` field (ISO 8601) from a
#   previous capture, which uniquely identifies it.
# --stop: kill any existing watcher on this directory and exit.
#   (Same effect as the sibling stop.sh; kept here as a convenience
#   when running watch.sh directly from a shell.)
# --print_selection: if a record has a selection, also print the
#   contents of the selection file after the JSON line (format:
#   "Selection:", blank line, file contents, blank line).
#
# If --directory is not given, looks for a .SeeWhatISee config file
# (in . then $HOME) with a directory=<path> setting.
#
# Detects changes by polling mtime every 0.5s.

Usage: watch.sh [OPTIONS]

Watch for new screenshots from the SeeWhatISee Chrome extension.

Options:
  --directory DIR   Directory to watch (default: ~/Downloads/SeeWhatISee)
  --loop            Keep watching after each emission (default: exit after one)
  --after TIMESTAMP Check log.json for captures newer than TIMESTAMP and emit
                    them immediately. TIMESTAMP is the `timestamp` field from a
                    previous capture (e.g. 2026-04-08T23:45:18.224Z).
  --stop            Stop any existing watcher on this directory and exit.
                    Equivalent to running the sibling stop.sh.
  --print_selection If a record has a selection, also print the selection
                    file's contents after the JSON line.
  --help            Show this help and exit.
